## Data Availability for the Hackathon
For accessing and managing data during the hackathon, we will be utilizing Nextcloud. You can access the platform at [nc.pnucolab.com](https://nc.pnucolab.com). To get started, please sign up for an account and await approval. Once your account is activated, you will find all relevant data organized under the “SCSOK Shares” directory. This centralized repository will serve as your primary source for all hackathon-related materials and information.
