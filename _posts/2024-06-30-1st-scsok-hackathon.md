We are excited to announce our first hackathon on single cell and spatial omics between Korean researchers!

## Details

- Date: January 19, 2024 - January 22, 2024
- Location: Oceans and Fisheries HRD Institute, Gijang, Busan

Welcome to the 1st Single Cell & Spatial Omics Hackathon, to be held at the Oceans and Fisheries HRD Institute in Gijang, Busan.
This exciting event, with significant participation from Korean researchers, will bring together experts, researchers, and data
scientists in a collaborative setting to innovate in the fields of single-cell and spatial omics data analysis. By joining this
hackathon, you'll have the chance to work with peers, engage with real-world datasets, and develop cutting-edge tools that provide
deep insights into single-cell and spatially resolved biological data. Our mission is to create efficient and scalable workflows
for analyzing both single-cell and spatially resolved genomic and proteomic data.

Single-cell and spatial omics are rapidly advancing fields, fueled by technological progress and the demand for comprehensive
analysis methods. This hackathon offers a unique platform for interdisciplinary collaboration, welcoming participants from
bioinformatics, software development, and spatial biology to share their expertise. Throughout the event, teams will work together,
with guidance from mentors, to develop prototypes within a set timeframe.

Please note that this is an invitation-only event. If you are interested, please reach out on the Zulip `hackathon` channel.
