Welcome to the 1st Single Cell & Spatial Omics Hackathon, to be held at the Oceans and Fisheries HRD Institute in Gijang, Busan.
This exciting event will bring together experts, researchers, and data scientists in Korea in a collaborative setting to innovate
in the fields of single-cell and spatial omics data analysis. By joining this hackathon, you'll have the chance to work with peers,
engage with real-world datasets, and develop cutting-edge tools that provide deep insights into single-cell and spatially resolved
biological data.

Single-cell and spatial omics are rapidly advancing fields, fueled by technological progress and the demand for comprehensive
analysis methods. This hackathon offers a unique platform for interdisciplinary collaboration, welcoming participants from
bioinformatics, software development, and spatial biology to share their expertise. Throughout the event, teams will work together,
with guidance from mentors, to develop prototypes within a set timeframe.

Please note that this is an invitation-only event. If you are interested, please reach out on the Zulip `hackathon` channel.
