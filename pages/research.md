## Single Cell & Spatial Omics Korea (SCSOK)

## ðŸ§¬  Welcome to the SCSOK Community!

Single Cell & Spatial Omics Korea (SCSOK) is a vibrant community of researchers in Korea dedicated to advancing the fields of single-cell and spatial omics studies. Our mission is to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and drive innovation in these cutting-edge areas of genomics research.

## ðŸš€ SCSOK Hackathons: Where Ideas Take Flight

At the heart of our community are the SCSOK Hackathons - dynamic events where creativity meets scientific rigor. These hackathons serve as a platform for:

- **Idea Exchange**: A melting pot of diverse thoughts and innovative approaches.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: An opportunity to learn from peers and experts in the field.
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Tackling complex biological questions with collective intelligence.
- **Cross-disciplinary Networking**: Forming connections that span various areas of expertise.

Our hackathons are all about sharing ideas freely in a supportive environment. We're not afraid to learn from our mistakes and grow together. And who knows? You might just find your next great research buddy along the way!

## ðŸ“š Navigating This Repository

This repository serves as an archive of the brilliant work produced during our hackathons. Here's how to make the most of it:

- **Data Category**: Common datasets used across projects are stored in the `DATA` category for easy access and reproducibility.
- **Project Folders**: Each hackathon project has its dedicated folder under the `_research` directory.

### How to Contribute or Update Your Project

1. Navigate to the [SCSOK GitHub repository](https://github.com/singlecell-spatialomics-korea/singlecell-spatialomics-korea.github.io).
2. Locate your project in the `_research` folder.
3. Follow the contribution guidelines in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file to make updates or additions to your work.

Thank you for visiting our SCSOK's Research page. Together, we're unlocking the secrets of cellular biology, one cell at a time. We look forward to seeing you at our next hackathon!
