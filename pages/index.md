## Single Cell & Spatial Omics Korea

Single Cell & Spatial Omics Korea is a community of researchers in Korea who are interested in single cell and spatial omics studies. We are a group of wet-lab and dry-lab researchers who are interested in single cell and spatial omics studies. We have a diverse background, including biology, medicine, computer science, mathematics, engineering, and statistics. We are interested in sharing our knowledge and experience to promote single cell and spatial omics studies in Korea.
